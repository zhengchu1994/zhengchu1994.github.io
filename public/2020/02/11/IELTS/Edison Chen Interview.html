<p>In the initial, I was just a star and a manager told me what to do every day. And one night, i was actually sold - like I was sold to another company. It was very <strong>demeaning</strong> to me and I felt very helpless. I <strong>felt like</strong> I was not in control of anything.</p>
<p>One a very important thing is that when I started being an actor or an entertainer in Hong Kong. People would always be making fun of the way i dress. And people would always be making fun of the way that I spoke or the way I stood.</p>
<p>I think hip-pop wasn’t such a big thing in <strong>the late nineteenth</strong>, early <strong>two thousands</strong> in Asia. </p>
<p>So at that moment, I was wondering why they wouldn’t understand what it was that we were doing. At the same time, in the American market there is a huge gap of  high-quality Chinese products or high-quality Chinese creativity. </p>
<p>So what we wanted to do was to bring the people that we loved and supported so dearly to China, and <strong>showcase</strong> these people. </p>
<p>But <strong>at the same time, being able to</strong> work with them and collaborate with them, and exchange creative ideas, so that we can be the same level. <strong>That’s the most important point,</strong> for us, it was to be recognized by people all around the world, that we are a Chinese band, but we’re fly too.</p>
<p>We are now actually working on some projects with Polo and with Ralph Lauren. I think it’s a sign of the times, you know.</p>
<p>So <strong>I really feel like</strong> the youths in China really need to <strong>open their eyes and realize that</strong> the world is within their grasp.</p>
<p>They just need to believe that they can get it.</p>
<p>Belif is something that is lacking with the youths of China.</p>
<p><strong>They always like to watch and enjoy, but they need to work hard and persevere and excel.</strong></p>
<p>I always tell this. In every place of the world, <strong>there are rules and regulations</strong>, not even in China, in America, in Europe- in everywhere. But in a creative world, there is no rule, there is no limit. The world is yours, your mind can expands anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>So you need to use that freedom in your everyday struggles.</strong></p>
<p>Now,  when they watch these hip-pop videos and they see the street culture stuff, they’re kind of like, “Wow, this is so fresh now, i like it.”</p>
<p>Why do you like it? They might not even know why they like it.</p>
<p>It’s because it represents something that they lack, <strong>that is</strong> to be able to think openly and <strong>be like</strong>, i can do this, and i will do this.</p>
