<li><p>Line graphs show numbers changing over a period of time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Line graph almost have 3 or 4 lines, <strong>compare the lines</strong>, not describe them separately. </p>
</li>
<li>First, make a very general comparison (Summary / Overview paragraph),such as highest and lowest lines；Second, compare the lines at specific points(Detailed paragraph), but we can’t describe everything, it’s better that write each one setence for each line.</li>

<li>EXAMPLE:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The line graph compares the <strong>amount of electricity produced</strong> in France using four different <strong>sources of</strong> power over a period of 32 years.</p>
<p>It is clear that nuclear power was <strong>by far the most important</strong> <strong>means of electricity generation</strong> <strong>over the period shown.</strong> Renewables <strong>provided</strong> the lowest amount of electricity in each year.</p>
<p>In 1980, thermal power stations were the main source of electricity in France, <strong>generating</strong> around 120 terawatt hours of power. Nuclear and hydroelectric power stations <strong>produced</strong> just under 75 terawatt hours of electricity each, and renewables provided <strong>a negligible amount</strong>. Just one year later, <strong>nuclear power overtook thermal power</strong> as the primary source of electricity.</p>
<p>Between 1980 and 2005, electricity production from nuclear power <strong>rose dramatically to a peak of</strong> 430 terawatt hours. <strong>By contrast</strong>, <strong>the figure for</strong> thermal power fell to only 50 terawatt hours in 1985, and <strong>remained at this level</strong> for the rest of the period. Hydroelectric power generation <strong>remained relatively stable</strong>, at between 50 and 80 terawatt hours for the whole 32-year period, but renewable electricity production <strong>saw only a small rise</strong> to approximately 25 terawatt hours by 2012.</p>

<p>The bar chart compares the number of mobile phones sold worldwide by the five most popular manufacturers in the years 2009, 2011 and 2013.</p>
<p>It is clear that Nokia sold the most mobile phones between 2009 and 2011, but Samsung became the best selling brand in 2013. Samsung and Apple saw the biggest rises in sales over the 5-year period.</p>
<p>In 2009, Nokia sold close to 450 million mobile phones, which was <strong>almost double</strong> the number of handsets sold by the <strong>second most seccessful</strong> maufacturer, Samsung. <strong>Over the following four years</strong>, however, Nokia’s <strong>sales figures fell by approximately 200 million units</strong>, <strong>whereas</strong> Samsung <strong>saw sales rise by a similar amount</strong>. By 2013, Samsung <strong>had become the market leader</strong> with sales reaching 450 million units. </p>
<p>The other three top selling mobile phone brands between 2009 and 2013 were <strong>LG, ZTE and Apple</strong>. In 2009, <strong>these companies sold</strong> around 125 million, 20 million and 25 million mobile handsets <strong>respectively</strong>, but <strong>Apple overtook the other two</strong> vendors in 2011.

<p>The table compares the five highest ranking countries in terms of the numbers of visits and the money spent by tourists over a period of two years.</p>
<p>It is clear that France was the world’s most popular tourist destination in the years 2012 and 2013. However, the USA earned by far the most revenue from tourism over the same period.</p>
<p>In  <strong>2012</strong>, 83 million tourists visited <strong>France</strong>, and the <strong>USA</strong> was the second most visited country, with 66.7 million tourists. <strong>Spain</strong> and <strong>China</strong> each received just under 58 million visitors, while <strong>Italy</strong> was ranked fifth with 46.4 million tourists. <strong>2013</strong> saw a rise of between 1 and 4 million tourist visits to each country, with the exception of China, which received 2 million fewer visitors than in the previous year.(Start with the highest number)</p>
<p>Spending by tourists visiting the USA increased from $126.2 billion in 2012 to $139.6 billion in 2013, and these figures were well over twice as high as  those for any other country. Spain received the second highest amounts of tourist revenue, rising from $56.3 billion to $60.4 billion, followed by France, China and Italy. Interestingly, despite falling numbers of tourists, Chinese revenue from tourism rose by $1.7 billion in 2013.</p>

<p>The diagram illustrates the manufacturing process of producing cheese by making(to make) use of raw milk.</p>
<p>We can see that there are overall seven steps to turn the raw milk materials into the end product, namely the matured cheese, including three steps that are required the assistance of productive machines.</p>
<p>At the first step in the raw milk are mixed with coagulum to produce the curds and whey, and then we separate these two to leave the curds only. Next, the collected curds are grounded by the grinding machine, at the same time, these curds are salted on the machine.</p>
<p>In the following step the salted curds are poured into some little rounded molds one by one, and then the moulded productions in boxes are compressed by the pressing machine. These productions take about 1 to 6 months in the maturation step, and finally getting the eatable and sellable matured cheese. (152 words)</p>

<ul>
<li>Explanation</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello, ZC.</p>
<p>“Overall” is can be an adjective or an adverb.</p>
<p>If you put “overall” at the beginning of the sentence, then it functions as an adverb.</p>
<p>Contrariwise, if you put “overall” after the noun “steps,” then it functions as an adjective.</p>
<p>We do not put “overall” before “seven” or “steps,” only after “steps.”</p>
<p>In this case, “required” means something that is needed for a particular purpose.</p>
<p>If I understood the sentence correctly, the three steps need to be taken into account for the machines to function productively.</p>
<p>I am slightly confused as to the meaning of “including three steps that are required the assistance of productive machines” due to the wording.</p>
<p>Could you provide me with more explanation as to what you were trying to say?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I hope that some of the above information helps.</p>

<ul>
<li>ANSWER</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Getting univerisity education have become more and more essential for people who live and work in intelligent society. Thus, it’s arguing that the government should support those quanlified students to go to campus by providing enough scholars. Though the government will cost lots of money, I believe this suggestion could largely belifit the whloe society. The reasons are twoflod.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Morden society have involving a great deal of high technologies in our daily life, those like smartphones, intelligent robots and even developing auto-driving cars all requiring well-educated users and developers more than ever before. Another realistic situation is that every leading companies have asked their employees at least have an degree in universities. </p>
<p>Secondly and more importantly, though the income of government will decrease in short-term, it is obvious that putting money into developing education could eventually promote the ecomnomy going to high-speed. As a bonus, the average social morality increasing as well as the well-educated citizens.</p>
<p>By the way of conclusion, I believe that this seggustion will be implement soon in the future as we have already being an high-technology era. It, therefore, demands further consideration of the government.（191 words, 1 hour）</p>

<p><strong>What are the advantages and disadvantages of living in the countryside?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>ANSWER</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>More and more people have been moving into coutryside to change their living envoriment for few years. Thus, there was a great deal of people talking about the cons and pros of living in such places. In my opinion, I believe living in rural counties have more the hinders than the convenients from the long-term period perspective, the reasons are twofold</p>
<p>Firstly, comparing with advanced big cities, such as Shanghai, Beijing, and Shenzhen, where there are a range of uncountable resources from high technologies such as high-speed railway, full covered 5G networks,  to educations such as teachers graduated as master or doctor, the coutryside governments cannot supply their local people with these resouces. Furthermore, unlike the comparatively international platform in modern cities, children live in rural counties lose more rights, such as high-quality education. </p>
<p>Secondly and most importantly, people who make their living in the first-tier city tend to have higher information literacy than those who even live in the three or four-tier city. Though they are frequently asked to work overtime and therefore carried more burdens as well, they make considerable money by using their metal intelligence. If they persist in hard work, they would have potentially keeped up to the rapid environment change.</p>
<p>By way of conclusion, I contend that living in a coutryside could lose more resources from both the material and education aspects in life. In contrast, the persuit of happiness have no obvious connections with living in first-tier cities. It, therefore, reminded young people who work in big cities not only work in day and night, but also try to live in a real happy life. (271 words)</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the prices and rents of living house have being increasing sharply recent decade. Consequently, a range of correlated drawbacks of high prices living places have emerged by breaking some normal relationship in society. Nevertheless, it is proposed a large number of corresponding measurements  to tackle these problems. There were the problems and solutions below.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the growing house prices require people who plan to purchase an apartment to make their efforts to make more money, leading to the overloaded pressures from both physically and mentally and cultivating unhealthful life style such as hard working in day and night. One the other hand, most of the buyers generally have some loads from banks to afford the first payment of buying house, though the first payment account for almost fifth of the total house prices, they must to pay back those banks during about two decades of their rest life.</p>
<p>Luckily, the government has already implemented few of policies to control the being manipulated real estate business, such as taking more taxies for those are already posessed two or more hourses, developing laws to protect those are being overwork in companies, and asking all legal companies provide fundamental insurance for their staff. Furthermore,  the government has been changing the structure of economy from manufactrure-based to technology-based, which could bring more oppotunities to earn good money into our society.</p>
<p>By way of conclusion, the government ought to take these disadvantages brought by increasing house prices into consideration. It can, therefore, eventually create normal and positive relationship among people.  (263 words)</p>
