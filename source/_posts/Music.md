I have no surprise that one of your favorite musical artists is Charlie Puth, his songs is also very popular in China, and he has a nickname in Chinese, called "断眉(duan mei)", which means that his eaybrow is broken(but it's pretty cool for him). And i found that i have listened some of your sharing songs before:

* **"See You Again"**  ( Very popular in China, there are a lot of  fans of the movie《The Fast and the Furious》,  in honor of Paul, a new version of this song is composed and made famous.)
* **"Something Just Like This"** (Very popular in China,  )
*  **"We Don't Talk Anymore"** (one of the top charts,  i remember in my second year of undergraduate, it was playing everday by my classmates in our dormitory)
* "Let Her Go" (I add this song in my Favorite list a few years ago.)

above songs in boldface i still listening usually,  and i listened to all the songs you recommended, some lyrics of these songs are interesting, and 断眉 is indeed a genius~hah, and by the way, you said you could send me the links of these songs in YOUTOBE, first thanks for your kindness.but truth is i can not visit the web since i am in my hometown, and i did not open the VPN service on my cellphone or purchase the Google Internet assistant that provides you to go to YOUTOBE or facebook, etc.



OK, let me recommend some songs. Avicii is a famous DJ, i did not listen to his songs, but time goes by and the feelings inside are changing as well, and i always listening foreign music without reading the lyrics, So my first feeling about all foreign music is come from the melody. Songs composed by Avicii can be very electronical, but once i noticed that the lyrics of his songs tell so much beauties about youth, life and time. I became appreciate his songs and habituate to this electronical style, especially when i do some daily exercise. Here is some of his songs:

* Fades Away(Tribute Concert Version)
* Wake Me Up
* Waiting For Love
* Without You
* Heaven(with ColdPlay)
* The Days(with Robbie Williams)



And some other English songs in my favorite list:

  * Another One Bites the Dust

  * Under Pressure(with David Bowie)

  * Bohemian Phapsody

  * We Will Rock You

    

* Masetti

  * Our Own Heaven

  

* Ed Sheeran

  * Shape of You

Some absolute music:
