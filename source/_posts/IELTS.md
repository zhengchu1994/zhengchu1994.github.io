>In China, the tide of opinion is now running steadily against homosexuality, in my opinion, I'm drawn toward the neutral view, here are several reasons to support my point of view. The first is that **someone** is born to be a homosexual, regardless of where they live, the society and government should support every citizen, including them, to **developing** a harmony society. On the contrast, someone **became** a homosexual just because they **indulge** in carnal pleasure without restraint,  It's a well-established fact that carnalism is pretty bad, and most important is that homosexual  **can** be more easily **effected** the AIDS than normal people.
