# Edison Chen Interview


> In the initial, I was just a star and a manager told me what to do every day. And one night, i was actually sold - like I was sold to another company. It was very **demeaning** to me and I felt very helpless. I **felt like** I was not in control of anything.
>
> 
>
> One a very important thing is that when I started being an actor or an entertainer in Hong Kong. People would always be making fun of the way i dress. And people would always be making fun of the way that I spoke or the way I stood.
>
> 
>
> I think hip-pop wasn't such a big thing in **the late nineteenth**, early **two thousands** in Asia. 
>
> 
>
> So at that moment, I was wondering why they wouldn't understand what it was that we were doing. At the same time, in the American market there is a huge gap of  high-quality Chinese products or high-quality Chinese creativity. 
>
> 
>
> So what we wanted to do was to bring the people that we loved and supported so dearly to China, and **showcase** these people. 
>
> 
>
> But **at the same time, being able to** work with them and collaborate with them, and exchange creative ideas, so that we can be the same level. **That's the most important point,** for us, it was to be recognized by people all around the world, that we are a Chinese band, but we're fly too.
>
> 
>
> We are now actually working on some projects with Polo and with Ralph Lauren. I think it's a sign of the times, you know.
>
> So **I really feel like** the youths in China really need to **open their eyes and realize that** the world is within their grasp.
>
> 
>
> They just need to believe that they can get it.
>
> Belif is something that is lacking with the youths of China.
>
> **They always like to watch and enjoy, but they need to work hard and persevere and excel.**
>
> I always tell this. In every place of the world, **there are rules and regulations**, not even in China, in America, in Europe- in everywhere. But in a creative world, there is no rule, there is no limit. The world is yours, your mind can expands anywhere.
>
> **So you need to use that freedom in your everyday struggles.**
>
> Now,  when they watch these hip-pop videos and they see the street culture stuff, they're kind of like, "Wow, this is so fresh now, i like it."
>
> Why do you like it? They might not even know why they like it.
>
> 
>
> It's because it represents something that they lack, **that is** to be able to think openly and **be like**, i can do this, and i will do this.
