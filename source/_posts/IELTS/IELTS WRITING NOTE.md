# PART ONE : 150-185 words at least.

* Remember: No conclusion. Instead write a summary(the overview). 

* Type 1 to 4 are more common, its related to **numbers** in ways of **describe, compare, changes, trends.** 

* Essays structure composed by 4 paragraphs:

  * 1. Introduction: 1 sentence to **paraphrase the question**.
  * 2. Overview: 2 setences about **the main, general things.**
  * 3. Details.   3 + 4 sentences for details.
  * 4. Details

  

  

## TYPE 1: Line graph

* Line graphs show numbers changing over a period of time.

* Line graph almost have 3 or 4 lines, **compare the lines**, not describe them separately. 
* First, make a very general comparison (Summary / Overview paragraph),such as highest and lowest lines；Second, compare the lines at specific points(Detailed paragraph), but we can't describe everything, it's better that write each one setence for each line.

* EXAMPLE:

> The line graph compares the **amount of electricity produced** in France using four different **sources of** power over a period of 32 years.
>
> It is clear that nuclear power was **by far the most important** **means of electricity generation** **over the period shown.** Renewables **provided** the lowest amount of electricity in each year.
>
> In 1980, thermal power stations were the main source of electricity in France, **generating** around 120 terawatt hours of power. Nuclear and hydroelectric power stations **produced** just under 75 terawatt hours of electricity each, and renewables provided **a negligible amount**. Just one year later, **nuclear power overtook thermal power** as the primary source of electricity.
>
> Between 1980 and 2005, electricity production from nuclear power **rose dramatically to a peak of** 430 terawatt hours. **By contrast**, **the figure for** thermal power fell to only 50 terawatt hours in 1985, and **remained at this level** for the rest of the period. Hydroelectric power generation **remained relatively stable**, at between 50 and 80 terawatt hours for the whole 32-year period, but renewable electricity production **saw only a small rise** to approximately 25 terawatt hours by 2012.





## TYPE 2: Bar chart

* The type of Bar charts  is the same as line graph
* Bar charts don't always show time... they often only compare numbers
* Our jobs is compare the bars. First, make a very general comparison. Second, compare specific details. 



* The example:(Paragraph 3 and 4: ABOUT: comparison, changes over times.)
* ![image-20200323154659205](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/00831rSTgy1gd3wral71pj316z0u0qc2.jpg)

>The bar chart compares the number of mobile phones sold worldwide by the five most popular manufacturers in the years 2009, 2011 and 2013.
>
>It is clear that Nokia sold the most mobile phones between 2009 and 2011, but Samsung became the best selling brand in 2013. Samsung and Apple saw the biggest rises in sales over the 5-year period.
>
>In 2009, Nokia sold close to 450 million mobile phones, which was **almost double** the number of handsets sold by the **second most seccessful** maufacturer, Samsung. **Over the following four years**, however, Nokia's **sales figures fell by approximately 200 million units**, **whereas** Samsung **saw sales rise by a similar amount**. By 2013, Samsung **had become the market leader** with sales reaching 450 million units. 
>
>The other three top selling mobile phone brands between 2009 and 2013 were **LG, ZTE and Apple**. In 2009, **these companies sold** around 125 million, 20 million and 25 million mobile handsets **respectively**, but **Apple overtook the other two** vendors in 2011. In 2013, **purchases of Apple handsets reached** 150 million units, **while** LG saw declining sales **and** the **figures for ZTE rose only slightly**.

* Language for process descriptions:  1. "steps" language; 2. passive verbs.

* "steps" language: 

  * At the first stage in the process
  * The process begins with
  * Secondly, Finally
  * The second step involves
  * Next, then, after that
  * At the following stage

* passive verbs:

  * Glass is collected.
  * Next, the collected glass is sorted by hand.
  * The sorted glass **is** then **ground** in a machine.

>The first flow diagram illustrates the process of glass container production, and the second diagram shows steps in the process of recycling used glass.
>
>We can see that glass is made using three main raw materials, and that the manufacturing process consists of four distinct stages. It requires five steps to turn used glass into new glass products.
>
>**At the first stage in** the production of glass, sand, soda ash, limestone and other chemicals are mixed together. **Next**, this mixture is heated in a glass furnace at approximately 1500*C  to produce molten glass. The molten glass can **then** be shaped, by blowing, to create the **end products**, namely glass containers.
>
>Glass recycling **begins with** the collection of used glass products. The collected glass is sorted according to its colour, **and then** washed in order to remove any impurities. **At the fourth stage** of recycling, the glass is crushed and melted, and the resulting molten glass can **finally** be moulded to create new items.

>The diagram illustrates the manufacturing process of producing cheese by making(to make) use of raw milk.
>
>We can see that there are overall seven steps to turn the raw milk materials into the end product, namely the matured cheese, including three steps that are required the assistance of productive machines.
>
>At the first step in the raw milk are mixed with coagulum to produce the curds and whey, and then we separate these two to leave the curds only. Next, the collected curds are grounded by the grinding machine, at the same time, these curds are salted on the machine.
>
>In the following step the salted curds are poured into some little rounded molds one by one, and then the moulded productions in boxes are compressed by the pressing machine. These productions take about 1 to 6 months in the maturation step, and finally getting the eatable and sellable matured cheese. (152 words)

* Explanation

>Hello, ZC.
>
>"Overall" is can be an adjective or an adverb.
>
>If you put "overall" at the beginning of the sentence, then it functions as an adverb.
>
>Contrariwise, if you put "overall" after the noun "steps," then it functions as an adjective.
>
>We do not put "overall" before "seven" or "steps," only after "steps."
>
>In this case, "required" means something that is needed for a particular purpose.
>
>If I understood the sentence correctly, the three steps need to be taken into account for the machines to function productively.
>
>I am slightly confused as to the meaning of "including three steps that are required the assistance of productive machines" due to the wording.
>
>Could you provide me with more explanation as to what you were trying to say?
>
>Nevertheless, I hope that some of the above information helps.



### MY PRACTICE 2 : TABLE

>The table compares the life expectancy of man and woman who were borned in 2014 and came from seven regions of the world, it also shows the average life expectancy in worldwide too.
>
>It is clear that female's life expectancy is totally longer than male's in every reported lands, ranging from 3 to 7 years. Besides, people from different places have largely gap in life expectancy by the same gender.
>
>Three areas, namely North America, Europe and Oceania, have shown that the top ranking life expectancy of woman and man, which are all above 80 and 74 years, respectively. The following two areas are Latin America combine with the Caribbean and Asia, people all have comparatively longer life expectancy which are all above 70 years. However, the Africa shown the lowest life span as man have lower than 60 years,which is 58 years, and woman only have 61 years.
>
>The worldwidely average life spans for male and female are 69 and 73 years, respectively. Compared with other regions, only those for Africa have belowing the worldwide life expectancy. While from the same gender, the highest life span of male from North America has totally longer than the average one, which up to 8 years. Furthermore, both North America and  Europe share the same life expectancy of female, it has also 8 years larger than the average from the world. (230 words)



# PART TWO : 250 -- 285 words 



We have four types of articles below, each one of them have different aims. Furthermore, I have shown my practicing writing essays, and the corresponding revised version by my teacher Nick as well.



* We could write two sentences in the first paragraph. The first one we have to paraphrase the question of this topic, and the second one we could write a general answer which gives our opinion and also introduces the following paragraphs.

* 第一段两句话：第一：引入topic(通过paraphrase题目引入)； 第二：general answer（抽象）;



## TYPE 1: Discussion



> Some people think that it is more effective for students to study in groups, while others believe that it is better for them to study alone. Discussion both views and give your own opinions.







> Topic - study in groups or alone
>
> Answer - Sometimes better alone, usually better in a group.



Ans: People have different views about the effectiveness of group study as opposed to working alone. **While** there are some **benefits to studying** independently, I believe that group work is usually more productive.



## TYPE 2: Opinion

> Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes.
>
> To what extent do you agree or disagree?



>Topic - community service for all teenagers
>
>Answer - Agree, Disagree, Balanced opinion(When possible)

Ans: It is sometimes argued that high school students **should be made** to do some work in their local communities. 

Dis: In my opinion, **it would be wrong** to force teenagers to do any kind of unsalaried work.

Bal: **While** I disagree with the idea of making such programmes compulsory, **I do believe** that voluntary community service could benefit young people.



## TYPE3 Problem and solution



>Many criminals reoffend after they  have been punished. Why do some people continue to commit crimes after they have been punished, and what measures can be taken to tackle this problem?



>Topic - criminals reoffend
>
>Answer - several **reasons**, a variety of **measures**(goverments, communities



Useful Advise: Paraphrase the Topic~



> It is true that punishments do not always **deter** criminals **from committing** more crimes.



## TYPE 4: Two-part question



> **As** most people spend a major part of their adult life at work, job satisfaction is an important element of individual well-being. 
>
> What factors contribute to job satisfaction?
>
> How realistic is the expectation of job satisfaction for all workers?



这时，每一个paragraph讨论一个问题。



> Topic -  job satisfaction
>
> Answer  - several factors, unrealistic / impossible



> Work plays a central role in our lives, and we **would** all like to feel fulfilled professionally. While a variety of factors may lead to job satisfaction, it **would be** unrealistic to expect everyone to be happy at work.

## MY OWN PRACTICIES



### MY PRACTICE 1



* QUESTION TYPE: Opinion

>**“A university education is the key to getting a good job. For that reason, the government should provide enough money to the universities, so that everyone can get a degree without paying for it."**
>
>**To what extent do you agree or disagree with tis statement?
> Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.**



* ANSWER

>Getting univerisity education have become more and more essential for people who live and work in intelligent society. Thus, it's arguing that the government should support those quanlified students to go to campus by providing enough scholars. Though the government will cost lots of money, I believe this suggestion could largely belifit the whloe society. The reasons are twoflod.
>
>Firstly, the Morden society have involving a great deal of high technologies in our daily life, those like smartphones, intelligent robots and even developing auto-driving cars all requiring well-educated users and developers more than ever before. Another realistic situation is that every leading companies have asked their employees at least have an degree in universities. 
>
>Secondly and more importantly, though the income of government will decrease in short-term, it is obvious that putting money into developing education could eventually promote the ecomnomy going to high-speed. As a bonus, the average social morality increasing as well as the well-educated citizens.
>
>By the way of conclusion, I believe that this seggustion will be implement soon in the future as we have already being an high-technology era. It, therefore, demands further consideration of the government.（191 words, 1 hour）



* Revised version:

  

### MY PRACTICE 2



* QUESTION TYPE: Opinion

>**What are the advantages and disadvantages of living in the countryside?**

* ANSWER

>More and more people have been moving into coutryside to change their living envoriment for few years. Thus, there was a great deal of people talking about the cons and pros of living in such places. In my opinion, I believe living in rural counties have more the hinders than the convenients from the long-term period perspective, the reasons are twofold
>
>Firstly, comparing with advanced big cities, such as Shanghai, Beijing, and Shenzhen, where there are a range of uncountable resources from high technologies such as high-speed railway, full covered 5G networks,  to educations such as teachers graduated as master or doctor, the coutryside governments cannot supply their local people with these resouces. Furthermore, unlike the comparatively international platform in modern cities, children live in rural counties lose more rights, such as high-quality education. 
>
>Secondly and most importantly, people who make their living in the first-tier city tend to have higher information literacy than those who even live in the three or four-tier city. Though they are frequently asked to work overtime and therefore carried more burdens as well, they make considerable money by using their metal intelligence. If they persist in hard work, they would have potentially keeped up to the rapid environment change.
>
>By way of conclusion, I contend that living in a coutryside could lose more resources from both the material and education aspects in life. In contrast, the persuit of happiness have no obvious connections with living in first-tier cities. It, therefore, reminded young people who work in big cities not only work in day and night, but also try to live in a real happy life. (271 words)

> There is no doubt that the prices and rents of living house have being increasing sharply recent decade. Consequently, a range of correlated drawbacks of high prices living places have emerged by breaking some normal relationship in society. Nevertheless, it is proposed a large number of corresponding measurements  to tackle these problems. There were the problems and solutions below.
>
> On the one hand, the growing house prices require people who plan to purchase an apartment to make their efforts to make more money, leading to the overloaded pressures from both physically and mentally and cultivating unhealthful life style such as hard working in day and night. One the other hand, most of the buyers generally have some loads from banks to afford the first payment of buying house, though the first payment account for almost fifth of the total house prices, they must to pay back those banks during about two decades of their rest life.
>
> Luckily, the government has already implemented few of policies to control the being manipulated real estate business, such as taking more taxies for those are already posessed two or more hourses, developing laws to protect those are being overwork in companies, and asking all legal companies provide fundamental insurance for their staff. Furthermore,  the government has been changing the structure of economy from manufactrure-based to technology-based, which could bring more oppotunities to earn good money into our society.
>
> By way of conclusion, the government ought to take these disadvantages brought by increasing house prices into consideration. It can, therefore, eventually create normal and positive relationship among people.  (263 words)
